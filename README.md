# vimrc

Please make sure your system has vim editor<br>
for Mac OS, please install homebrew package manager (<a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew website</a>)<br>
I suggest to use homebrew to install vim instead of using system built in vim (for clipboard issue)<br>
(brew install vim)

### Usage:

```
git clone https://github.com/yojo3000/vimrc.git ~/vimrc; sh ~/vimrc/install_(your OS).sh
