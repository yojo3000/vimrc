# vimrc
Mars' vimrc

Please make sure your system has vim editor<br>
for Mac OS, please install homebrew package manager (<a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew website</a>)<br>
I suggest to use homebrew to install vim instead of using system built in vim (for clipboard issue)<br>
(brew install vim)

vimrc only suggest to use on Mac for now, it looks just like shit in linux...<br>
